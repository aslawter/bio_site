			<h2>
				Other Enjoyable Stuff
			</h2>
			<p>Andrew's interests are varried, but mostly he just likes treating free time like, well, free time.  Andrew prefers to live in the moment, and to leave the project planning of "free time" to others.  On good days those free moments are spent out in the woods, on a rock face, or just somewhere that's 60 degrees and sunny with a cool mountain breeze.</p>
			<p>When Andrew is not working he's usually doing one of these things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rock Climbing</li>
				<li>Having a blast with the lovely wife</li>
				<li>Taming wild beasts like our dog Pepper</li>
				<li>Traveling</li>
				<li>Enjoying leisurely weekend breakfasts cooked on a cast iron skillet and accompanied by strong black coffee</li>
				<li>Nerding around on the computer, or with my latest gear gadget</li>
				<li>Re-learning all the basics of HTML and CSS that I dabbled in oh-so many years ago</li>
			</ul>
